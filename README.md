# ErgoDAO White Paper

**Abstract**

ErgoDAO is an investment DAO with the strategic intent of seamlessly coordinating financial and human resources for Ergo ecosystem projects. ErgoDAO aims to assist the adoption of the Ergo blockchain for dapps, tools, exchanges, etc.

The Ergo manifesto states that "All code for the core protocol must remain fully open and transparent. Every line should be fully auditable and transparent. This prevents manipulation and builds decentralized resiliency".&#x20;

**ErgoDAO intends to mirror this principle and decentralize all governance and open-source all development, aligning all work with the Ergo manifesto.**

We propose the following investment strategy:

Phase I: Strategic capital 100%

Phase II: Strategic capital 70%; Community contribution incentives to ErgoDAO investments 30%

Capital is the main factor that accelerates strong founding teams in the initial phase - it enables teams to develop early-stage projects from MVP to TestNet; this explains the weighting given to capital.

Mainnet to Testnet can be a developer-intensive process, and significant resources can be necessary for non-tech issues, such as marketing and legal. To ensure that projects have the best chance of success, ErgoDAO will incentivize contributions from developers and business operations experts.

Following a successful pilot, ErgoDAO intends to approach supportive DAO funders such as BitDAO to raise significant capital in three tranches. Initially, $30M will be requested, followed by two additional tranches of $30M based on milestones reached and funder governance vote approval.
