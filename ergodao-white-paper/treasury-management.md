# Treasury Management

### **DAO Structure and Treasury Management**

It is proposed at this stage that ErgoDAO will use Syndicate.io, Snapshot and Gnosis Safe, plus additional platforms to manage contributions and incentivization.

When a native Ergo solution is ready, the DAO will transition. ErgoDAO has contacted Ergopad, the developers of the Paideia DAO software suite. We have told Ergopad that we are interested in transitioning as soon as they are ready.

We plan to deploy a GnosisSafe multisig with N-of-M signers comprised of the Executive Team to get to the market quickly and fulfil this vision. The solutions like GnosisSafe can be rapidly deployed and have been battle-tested with other significant community treasuries.
