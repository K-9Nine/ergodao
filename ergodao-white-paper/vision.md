# Vision

Ergo is likely to become a global leader in the blockchain industry. Our mission at ErgoDAO is to align closely with Ergo Foundation's fundamental values: development of the Ergo ecosystem, decentralized infrastructure, social good, and privacy as a fundamental human right.&#x20;

As the Ergo manifesto states, "Ergo Platform had a fair launch in the very beginning. It didn't hold any ICO, and there weren't any pre-mined coins for the platform's founders. Decentralization and fairness of a peer to peer monetary system was the priority in the first place."

No centralized fund is promoting or offering grants to Ergo developers, and the foundation's resources are somewhat limited compared to other technologically inferior projects. The ErgoDAO aims to level playing fields and raise strategic community capital to support and promote Ergo ecosystem development.

Ergo is a technology-focused project; Ergo's core community is technologically savvy without a large marketing budget. The ErgoDAO seeks to enhance the Ergo ecosystem's competitive advantage by bringing together the mass of intellectual capital in the Ergo community.  &#x20;

With the ErgoDAO, participants will not just gain financial exposure to the Ergo ecosystem (via rights in ErgoDAO and Ergo projects funded via strategic capital allocation). Making the Ergo ecosystem thrive will require the efficient allocation of human capital in an organized and efficient manner. We can develop, market, and brainstorm for our ecosystem by working together. It would be fantastic if ErgoDAO could accomplish this.

ErgoDAO believes that you should have the opportunity to gain ownership of the things you're contributing meaningful value to. You should have the chance to contribute to the very best Ergo projects emerging today and in the future. ErgoDAO is a formalized decentralized structure established with this very need at its core.
