# Investment

ErgoDAO is a for profit investment DAO.\
\
The strategic intent for ErgoDAO is to raise and invest $100m in the Ergo ecosystem over the next 5 years.\
\
An initial pilot (Phase I) will target a raise of $2m-$5m with a follow-on investment of $5m over 12-18 months. Phase I funding will be followed by additional capital calls based on milestones and results outlined during Phase 1. Additional capital calls will be approved by the Executive Team.

There will be more opportunity to invest in more projects as the Ergo ecosystem grows. It is anticipated that three tranches of $30 million will be sought. The list of milestones this investment is subject to is not exhaustive, but will include the number of investments completed, the number of grants awarded, the relevance and importance of the projects funded, the member contributions made by ErgoDAO, and any other KPIs the Executive Team adds.

ErgoDAO will **target** an IRR equivalent to that of a successful venture capital fund. ErgoDAO will target an IRR of **at least 30% when investing at the seed stage**. ErgoDAO will target an IRR of 20% for later stages, given that those investments are generally less risky. **These statements are a guide and should not be relied upon.**

**Investments through ErgoDAO are long-term investments that may take several years to yield a return (and investment returns are not guaranteed).**&#x20;

**ErgoDAO is not without risk. Your capital is at risk and projected returns are not guaranteed.**&#x20;

**Investing in ErgoDAO carries a significant risk of losing all of your money. ErgoDAO's investments may not be listed on any recognized exchange or traded there. If you need to get your money back quickly, you will not be able to sell your investment easily.**
