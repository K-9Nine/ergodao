# Intellectual Capital

****

Today, every blockchain company is familiar with the lack of and high cost of specialist human resources. Marketeers, cryptographic developers, and blockchain developers are all hard to find.&#x20;

ErgoDAO is an investment DAO and aims to support the development of the Ergo ecosystem with financial capital. However, this is not the core competency of the DAO.&#x20;

ErgoDAO's impact will be as strong as its membership, and long-term contributors will be a necessity. ErgoDAO will actively recruit contributors who will become extremely valuable pillars of intellectual capital in the Ergo ecosystem. These experts will be encouraged to participate in DAO projects, and experts will have experience in strategy, tokenomics, cryptography, blockchain development, security, and marketing. By calling on these contributors, ErgoDAO can assist ecosystem projects in succeeding and realizing their full potential.

As a result, ErgoDAO will truly position itself as "strategic" money because of this intellectual capital.

Operationally ErgoDAO will focus on five separate but complementary pillars in no particular order:&#x20;

1\) Supporting the growth of Ergo ecosystem ventures that have shown traction

2\) Supporting strategic Ergo ecosystem initiatives

3\) Incubation of idea stage (pre-seed) ventures&#x20;

4\) Support projects progressing the research and development in the Ergo ecosystem

5\) Investing strategic capital in the Ergo ecosystem

The list is not exhaustive, and ErgoDAO may add or remove pillars in the future.

All DAO members will have the opportunity to participate in projects approved by ErgoDAO. The projects will be transparent, and payments will be made when tasks are completed.
