# Why a DAO?

### Why a DAO?

For a DAO to succeed, it should seamlessly integrate financial and human capital, which is ErgoDAO's strategic intent.

The Ergo manifesto states that "Ergo should be as decentralized as possible. Always strive to spread and grow. Any party's social leaders, software developers, hardware manufacturers, miners, funds need to avoid central points of failure."

There is no central authority or entity managing DAOs. Instead, a DAO is an Internet native company collectively owned and operated by its members using smart Blockchain contracts. Therefore, the structure of a DAO aligns with Ergo's core values.
