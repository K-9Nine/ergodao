# Funding

ErgoDAO will raise capital via token issuance. ErgoDAO plans to raise further funding following the successful pilot, subject to milestones and achievements approved by the Executive Team and investor approval. Once ErgoDAO starts the dissolution process, the Executive Team will delegate this power to members.

Following initial funding, the Executive Team will approve additional capital calls based on the milestones and achievements outlined in Phase 1. Among these milestones are:

* The number of investments completed.
* The number of grants.
* The importance and relevance of public goods funded.
* Core DAO tool contributions.
* Other performance metrics that the Executive Team may decide to add.

When additional capital is needed to complete strategic initiatives, voting members can submit a request to the Executive Team by following a submission process that ErgoDAO will define in Phase 1.
