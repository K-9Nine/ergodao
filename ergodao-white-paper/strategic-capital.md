# Strategic Capital

A key component of accelerating strong founding teams is capital - the most crucial element in enabling teams to develop early-stage projects from MVP through to Testnet.

The DAO will fund various verticals to help develop, foster and support the Ergo ecosystem. Given Ergo's general-purpose nature, the Executive Team will review this list regularly and add more verticals as they mature.

Funding will focus initially on the following verticals: Defi, NFTs, Games, Payments, Privacy, Interoperability, Oracles, Data Management, Data Analytics, File Storage, DAOs, Digital Identity, and Social.
