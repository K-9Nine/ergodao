# Phase I

### **Pilot execution**

The first goal in the pilot will be to establish an Executive Team as well as a thriving Discord community.

Executive Team will establish a legal structure and decision-making procedures for the DAO.&#x20;

* It is proposed that ErgoDAO will be formed as an LLC.&#x20;
* It is proposed that Syndicate.io will be used for financing and legal incorporation.&#x20;
* We propose to use Snapshot's Whitelist Strategy as the voting platform. This strategy returns votes for addresses that match a static whitelist.

The contributory DAO team will remain small during the early stages, probably between 25 and 50 members. This team will ensure that all information is transparent and available for review and comment by the broader community.

The Executive Team will be composed initially of hand-picked Ergo experts from the Ergo community to expand during the soft proposal process.

In an ideal world, this would consist of 3 ErgoDAO representatives, 1 Ergo representative, and 3 Ergo community members or partners, one of whom would be a finance expert.

As the Executive Team evolves, people from the ecosystem, academia, investment, and business community will be added - subject to community approval.&#x20;
