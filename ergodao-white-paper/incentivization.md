# Incentivization

### Compensation

To make DAOs successful, we must recognize our efforts and reward each other. Using Coordinape is an example of a tool that does just that. Our goal at ErgoDAO is to go beyond just paying people - to make the experience of working with us more rewarding, human, and fair.

ErgoDAO plans to implement tools to fairly and openly incentivize useful work on projects in the Ergo Ecosystem.
