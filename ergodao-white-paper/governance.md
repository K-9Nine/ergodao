# Governance

Ideally, we would like to be able to run ErgoDAO in a fully decentralized manner from day one.&#x20;

The complete decentralization of decision-making is ErgoDAO's strategic aim. Still, to achieve that, the DAO needs to grow with agility, allowing the Executive Team to focus and not be marred by an unnecessary voting process on every decision.

For the DAO to be successful in the long run, it must make swift, intelligent and strategic decisions in the short term. The Executive Team will manage this process initially.

It is proposed to use Snapshot's Whitelist Strategy as the voting platform. This strategy returns votes for addresses that match a static whitelist.
